# Contribution guidelines

Contributions are very welcome, but please stick to these guidelines.

## Filing issues

If you found a bug or want to propose a feature, check out existing issues
first. If you don't find anything similar, make sure you describe your issue
in informative and constructive way.

## Resolving issues

You can take any approved unassigned issue (especially ones marked with "help
wanted") and provide a solution for it. But unless solution is trivial, make
sure to mention you're working on this issue. Feel free to ask for help.

When you resolved an issue, make a pull request and wait for it to be reviewed.
You might be asked to fix issues in your request.

## Content contribution

Even more so than with code, you should discuss what you're planning to do
first.
